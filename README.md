# tres-home-assignment

This is my home assignment for Tres.Finance.
this application was bootstrapped using the vue CLI.
below are the instructions on running the application.
For security reasons, I did not commit the provided mock data to the repository, so before running the project, please place the mock data file under `src/assets` under the name `data.json`.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration
